# üßæ On-Chain Invoice

A decentralized invoice management system built on blockchain technology. This project serves as a hands-on training ground for Solidity and React development, implementing a fully on-chain invoice solution.

## üéØ Overview

On-Chain Invoice is a small project designed to practice Solidity smart contract development and React frontend integration. Built with a test-driven development approach and modern tooling including Solidity, Hardhat, Vite, and React.

## ‚ú® Features

### Create Invoices
- **Itemized Billing**: Create invoices with multiple items, each containing:
  - Title
  - Quantity
  - Price per unit
- **Address Attribution**: Optionally assign an invoice to a specific address, restricting payment to that address only
- **Flexible Access**: If no address is assigned, anyone can pay the invoice

### Manage Invoices
- **Payment Processing**: Pay invoices using cryptocurrency
- **Owner Controls**: As the invoice creator, you can delete your unpaid invoices at any time
- **Payer Rights**: Once an invoice is paid, the payer can also delete it
- **Full On-Chain Storage**: All invoice data is permanently stored on the blockchain
